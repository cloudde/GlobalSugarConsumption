Global Sugar Consumption Analysis | Python Data Project
Explore, visualize, and analyze worldwide sugar intake trends with Python.

This repository provides a data-driven approach to understanding global sugar consumption patterns using statistical analysis, geospatial mapping, and time-series forecasting.

Key Features:
✔ Data Processing: Clean, transform, and merge sugar consumption datasets from WHO, FAO, and other public sources.
✔ Interactive Visualizations: Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn charts for country/regional comparisons.
✔ Trend Analysis: Yearly consumption trends, per-capita intake, and correlations with economic factors.
✔ Machine Learning (Optional): Predictive models for future consumption based on historical data.
✔ Reproducible Research: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis and documentation.

Perfect for data analysts, public health researchers, and Python enthusiasts looking to explore nutritional datasets. Contributions welcome!

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Plotly), Jupyter Notebook
