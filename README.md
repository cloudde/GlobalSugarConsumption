Global Sugar Consumption Analysis | Python Data Project
Explore, visualize, and analyze worldwide sugar intake trends with Python.

This repository provides a data-driven approach to understanding global sugar consumption patterns using statistical analysis, geospatial mapping, and time-series forecasting.

Key Features
-- Data Processing: Clean and merge datasets (CSV + SHP) using pandas and geopandas.

-- Interactive Maps: Choropleth visualizations of per-country consumption with dynamic yearly trends.

-- Trend Analysis: Statistical summaries (mean, median, std) and animated GIFs (imageio) to track changes over decades.

-- Missing Data Handling: Automated detection and imputation for seamless analysis.

-- Publication-Ready Plots: Custom-styled visualizations with matplotlib, seaborn, and "rocket" colormap.

Perfect for data analysts, public health researchers, and Python enthusiasts looking to explore nutritional datasets. Contributions welcome!

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Plotly), Jupyter Notebook
